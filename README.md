This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup
- yarn create react-app react-profile-editor - this creates the app and also runs yarn install
- yarn start to start the server locally.
- Remove default fill content from App.js and App.css
- Create components folder within the src directory
- Set initial state and get it to render using components

## Key steps
- Render out hard coded data
- Model your data
- Add state to your app
- Make render use app's state (replacing the hardcoded data from render)
- Handle events from interactive elements (onClick, onChange)
- Connect those to methods that update the app's state (this.setState)

## Models
### User
- first name
- last name
- profile image

## State
Turning data into HTML elements or turning user interaction back into data. 

## Notes
you don't have to use 'const' inside the app because declaring the variable without sets an instant variable - when you're within classes, you don't have to use const. 

## Challenges

1. Add editable last name field
2. Add editable image URL field
3. Make two ShowProfile and EditProfile components that renders the showing of the userâ€™s info, and renders the fields for editing their info
4. Add toggle button to switch between either profile viewing and editing
5. (Advanced) Add a 'Random' button that uses fetch or axios to load random user information from https://randomuser.me/api/
6. (Advanced) Add prettier to automatically format code:
   - Add a yarn format script to run prettier on all code in the ./src directory
   - Add a prettier pre-commit hook
